# Automatic-Prediction-Edition
Using data from the previous beta, the prediction edition introduces the motion sensor AI to Automatic! In continuous manners,
the AI can recognize shot wrist motions and even return vertical tilt angle (aka release angle) back to the user! In this app, we also figured out how to
ask the user for privacy permissions to utilize the motion sensor, which caused major crashes in the previous beta.

This is mostly just a testing beta to show proof that the motion sensor AI works efficiently in real time. There are some bugs and lack od data that will
be adressed in the next beta! Next up is analyzing the shots, making an AI to detect make and miss inputs, creating a firebase data set and gathering more 
metrics!
